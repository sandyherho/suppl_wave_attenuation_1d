WAVE ENERGY DENSITY ANALYSIS
============================

Dense Vegetation (cD = 1.4 s⁻¹):
--------------------------------
Peak energy density: 910.9 J/m³
Minimum energy density: 0.0 J/m³

Time-averaged energy density:
  Before vegetation (x < 80 m): 454.4 J/m³
  Within vegetation (80 ≤ x ≤ 120 m): 47.4 J/m³
  After vegetation (x > 120 m): 0.1 J/m³

Energy dissipation: 100.0%

Sparse Vegetation (cD = 0.14 s⁻¹):
----------------------------------
Peak energy density: 1479.0 J/m³
Minimum energy density: 358.9 J/m³

Time-averaged energy density:
  Before vegetation (x < 80 m): 737.0 J/m³
  Within vegetation (80 ≤ x ≤ 120 m): 491.5 J/m³
  After vegetation (x > 120 m): 363.5 J/m³

Energy dissipation: 50.7%

WAVE ENERGY FLUX ANALYSIS
=========================
Group velocity (shallow water): 4.43 m/s

Dense Vegetation:
-----------------
Energy flux before vegetation: 2012.8 W/m
Energy flux after vegetation: 0.2 W/m
Flux reduction: 100.0%

Sparse Vegetation:
------------------
Energy flux before vegetation: 3264.4 W/m
Energy flux after vegetation: 1610.0 W/m
Flux reduction: 50.7%

POWER DISSIPATION
=================
Power dissipated per unit width within vegetation zone:
  Dense vegetation: 50.3 W/m²
  Sparse vegetation: 41.4 W/m²

Dissipation effectiveness ratio (Dense/Sparse): 1.22

ENERGY-BASED TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT
=====================================
Kt,E = sqrt(E_out/E_in):
  Dense vegetation: 0.010
  Sparse vegetation: 0.702

SUMMARY
=======
The dense vegetation (cD = 1.4 s⁻¹) dissipates 100.0% of the incident
wave energy, while sparse vegetation (cD = 0.14 s⁻¹) dissipates 50.7%.
This corresponds to a 1.2-fold increase
in dissipation effectiveness for the denser canopy.

The energy-based transmission coefficients confirm the wave height-based values,
validating the numerical solution and demonstrating the strong attenuation
capacity of dense vegetation for coastal protection applications.
